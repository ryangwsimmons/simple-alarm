# Simple Alarm

</p>
A simple alarm application written in Python with a GUI using GTK+ 3. For some reason an application like this doesn't seem to have been created yet (besides KAlarm, which is relatively complicated if you want to just set a simple alarm), so I decided to create it myself.

**Note**: This project is a ***work in progress***. It does not currently run and operate as expected. Obviously, I plan to fix that, but for the time being don't be surprised if you clone the repo and it doesn't work.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- GTK+ 3.0 or higher
- gobject-introspection
